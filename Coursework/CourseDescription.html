  <p> <b>1. Business Analytics Experience</b> (BZAN550 - 3 credit hours):
  Application of the principles of analytics through a team-based, experiential
project. Students work on a real-world business problem through the stages of problem
identification, data acquisition and preparation, analysis, determination of recommendations, 
and presentation of findings. This is the capstone course for the Masters in Business Analytics,
taken in the fall semester of the second year. Students work in teams with a client in industry or
government. Each team has a faculty coach. Throughout the semester, students work with skills
coaches in the areas of teamwork, leadership and communication. </p>

  <p> <b>2. Design of Experiments</b> (BZAN553 - 3 credit hours):

This course covers exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, dimension reduction
techniques, clustering, outlier detection, association analysis, and select advanced methods.
We emphasize hands-on experience with real-world data challenges (e.g., data quality,

power of large amounts of textual data.
This course is designed to be a general introductory level course for all graduate students who
are interested in text mining.
Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
(i). Conceptually understand the mechanism of advanced text mining algorithms for information
extraction, text classification and clustering, sentiment analysis and opinion mining, and topic
modeling;
(ii). Formulate text mining problems in real applications, choose appropriate technologies for
specific text analysis tasks, and evaluate the benefits and challenges of the chosen technical
solution; and
(iii). Use benchmark corpora or textual data extracted from a particular domain of interest and
use open-source text analysis tools (e.g., R and/or Python) to clean textual data, explore
interesting patterns, and create useful applications.  </p>
  
<p> <b>5. Categorical Data Analysis</b> (STAT578 - 3 credit hours):
This course covers exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, dimension reduction
techniques, clustering, outlier detection, association analysis, and select advanced methods.
We emphasize hands-on experience with real-world data challenges (e.g., data quality,
complexity, and low signal-noise ratios), encourage creative thinking in making use of available
data, and practice scripting language programming (R and/or Python) to analyze multivariate
data.  </p>

1. <b>1. Applied Regression Analysis for Business</b> (BZAN540 - 3 credit hours):
Regression methodology forms the core of modern applied statistics.
This course will emphasize basic analysis skills that will be required of Business Analytics
Professionals in almost any career path. Mathematical, methodological, and computational
concepts learned in this course will be critical to lifelong learning in this area. Topics covered
include: linear model formulation, inference, diagnostics and variable selection, logistic
regression model formulation and inference, an introduction to generalized linear models,
models for survival analysis, an introduction to design of experiments, and some topics on causal inference from observational data. The R programming environment is utilized for computations,
and the rmarkdown notebook for reports and presentations.  </p>  
  
<p> <b>2. Data Mining Methods for Business Applications</b> (BZAN542 - 3 credit hours):
Each data mining project one will ever engage in involves six phases: business
understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, model evaluation, and model
deployment. This course teaches students all the skills that are needed to successfully complete
these phases. Students will work with technology (called ‘R’ and ‘Python’) that contains the latest
algorithm developments. To be able to use R and Python students will learn how to
program/code. Algorithms covered include: Naïve Bayes, Regularized Logistic, Neural Networks,
K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Bagged Trees, Random Forest,
Adaptive Boosting, Rotation Forest, Hoeffding Trees, K-means.
Students will learn
(i)to program/code in R and Python,
(ii)to process and manipulate data,
(iii)to understand and apply high performance data mining and machine learning algorithms,
(iv)to tune and evaluate models,
(v)how to collaborate on data mining problems. </p>  
  
 <p> <b>3. Enterprise Data Management for Business Analytics</b> (BZAN543 - 1.5 credit hours):
A majority of large enterprises use SAS software. This course focuses on software to manage
and manipulate large data sets in preparation for analysis using the SAS data step, PROC SQL, and the
SAS macro language. Brief attention will be given to other SQL tools.  </p>  
  
  <p> <b>4. Decision Support Systems for Business Analytics</b> (BZAN544 - 1.5 credit hours):
This course introduces Python programming language and Visual Basic for Applications
for Excel. Students will learn the syntax of the programming languages, work with various
modules, and build decision models with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Students will gain experience with using Python modules for
• reading and writing text files;
• reading and writing Excel files;
• analyzing data by applying statistical models;
• plotting the data and regression lines.
Visual Basic for Applications for Excel will be used to
• manipulate Excel objects;
• build graphical user interfaces for easy real-time user interaction and/or feedback.
Students will work in teams on a final group project to combine Python and VBA skills and
connect the two to build a visualization of anonymized real-world business problem solution.  </p>

<p> <b>6. Simulation Modeling</b> (BZAN546 - 1.5 credit hours):
This course provides an introduction to computer simulation for
business decision making. Students learn modeling techniques, and tools from the
areas of Monte-Carlo and discrete-event simulation, including random number
generators, distribution fitting, input and output analysis. Students are exposed to
real-world applications of simulation in areas such as process modeling and
analysis, capacity management, supply chain management, and health care
operations. In addition to 3 case-based homework assignments, students work in
teams on one real-world simulation project, usually sponsored by a local
company. The teams present their project recommendations in an oral
presentation to a panel of faculty members and company representatives. 
  The course will equip students with the ability to:
• develop a basic understanding of Monte-Carlo and discrete-event
simulation concepts, rooted in probability and statistical theory
• recognize situations that are best suited for simulation modeling
  build appropriate simulation models using GUI-driven, discrete-event
