</p>  
  
  <p> <b>4. Quantitative Methods for Business Analytics</b> (BZAN533 - 5 credit hours):
This course introduces the fundamentals of probability and statistical inference as it is
applied in business analytics. One key skill in the business analytics skills toolbox is statistical
modeling, and an effective model hinges upon a deep understanding of probability distributions
and how things processes vary. The course covers in both a qualitative and quantitative
manner the most popular distributions used by practitioners. Inferences about the frequency
of each value of the distribution or the average of the distribution will be discussed leading into
the framework of hypothesis testing, estimation, and making confidence intervals for unknown
parameters.
A second major component of this class involves learning the open-source software R for
statistical programming. Proficiency in programmings opens the world of analytics beyond
canned analyses, allowing you to conduct analyses where the only limit is your own innovation
and creativity. Key concepts in control structures (loops, conditionals, function-development)
are covered, especially how they relate to Monte Carlo simulation and ad-hoc testing.
Additional topics such as data structures, data manipulation (queries, joins), matrices (Markov
Chains), and optimization (using calculus and maimum likelihood estimation) are covered.
Several case studies which may include gauging customer similarity, estimating the lifetime
value of a customer, studying churn rates, predicting consumer spending, and predicting the
success or failure of a product launch are included as well. 
</p>  
  
   <p> <b>5. Statistical Methods for Business</b> (BZAN535 - 3 credit hours):
This course begins with learning to query relational databases using MySQL. This skill
is reinforced throughout the semester as students query the dunnhumby Journey and Carbo
tables to acquire the data to be analyzed for homework and projects. The second topic is data
visualization. JMP’s GraphBuilder and Tableau are introduced and each used to display
graphical summaries of data. The subsequent statistical methods coverage is divided into four
topics, depending on whether the response variable is numeric or categorical, and whether the
explanatory variable is numeric or categorical:
• When the response and explanatory variables are numeric, the statistical methods
involve scatterplots and regression.
• When the response is numeric and the explanatory variable is categorical, the statistical
methods involve side-by-side box plots and ANOVA.
• When the response and explanatory variables are both categorical, the analysis is via
contingency tables.
• When the response is categorical with two categories and the explanatory variable is
numeric, the analysis is v loiagistic regression. Logistic regression is widely used in
business application to estimate customer behaviors, such as purchases, churn, loan
default, etc.
