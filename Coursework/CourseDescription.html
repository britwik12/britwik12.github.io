  <p> <b>1. Business Analytics Experience</b> (BZAN550 - 3 credit hours):
  Application of the principles of analytics through a team-based, experiential
project. Students work on a real-world business problem through the stages of problem
identification, data acquisition and preparation, analysis, determination of recommendations, 
and presentation of findings. This is the capstone course for the Masters in Business Analytics,
taken in the fall semester of the second year. Students work in teams with a client in industry or
government. Each team has a faculty coach. Throughout the semester, students work with skills
coaches in the areas of teamwork, leadership and communication. </p>

  <p> <b>2. Design of Experiments</b> (BZAN553 - 3 credit hours):
This course provides an introduction to design and analysis of experiments. Students
will understand the basic principles of design of experiment, that is randomization, replication
and blocking. It will cover topics such as factorial and fractional factorial designs, designs for
conjoint analysis, optimal designs, split unit designs, orthogonal arrays. Students will learn
these concepts through real examples, with particular emphasis in business applications.
Students will work in teams to carry out a real experiment and present their results based on
the data collected from the experiment.  </p>
  
  <p> <b>3. Multivariate and Data Mining Techniques</b> (BZAN552 - 3 credit hours):
This course covers exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, dimension reduction
techniques, clustering, outlier detection, association analysis, and select advanced methods.
We emphasize hands-on experience with real-world data challenges (e.g., data quality,
complexity, and low signal-noise ratios), encourage creative thinking in making use of available
data, and practice scripting language programming (R and/or Python) to analyze multivariate
data.  </p>
  
  <p> <b>4. Text Mining</b> (BZAN557 - 3 credit hours):
This course will introduce computational methods, rooted from machine learning,
natural language processing, and statistics, to find patterns in large text corpora, unlocking the
power of large amounts of textual data.
This course is designed to be a general introductory level course for all graduate students who
are interested in text mining.
Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
(i). Conceptually understand the mechanism of advanced text mining algorithms for information
extraction, text classification and clustering, sentiment analysis and opinion mining, and topic
modeling;
(ii). Formulate text mining problems in real applications, choose appropriate technologies for
specific text analysis tasks, and evaluate the benefits and challenges of the chosen technical
solution; and
(iii). Use benchmark corpora or textual data extracted from a particular domain of interest and
use open-source text analysis tools (e.g., R and/or Python) to clean textual data, explore
interesting patterns, and create useful applications.  </p>
  
<p> <b>5. Categorical Data Analysis</b> (STAT578 - 3 credit hours):
This course covers exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, dimension reduction
techniques, clustering, outlier detection, association analysis, and select advanced methods.
We emphasize hands-on experience with real-world data challenges (e.g., data quality,
complexity, and low signal-noise ratios), encourage creative thinking in making use of available
data, and practice scripting language programming (R and/or Python) to analyze multivariate
data.  </p>
